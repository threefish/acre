### Acre is an open development environment for developing web apps using Javascript ###

Acre is the backend for the [Freebase Apps](http://www.freebase.com/apps/) platform, which provides hosted, social app development using server-side Javascript.

This open source release allows you to run Acre on your own server.

Features:

  * server side coding in Javascript
  * cross-app `require()` gives you the ability to safely share code
  * particularly suited to apps that use Freebase data (fast freebase API queries on the back-end)
  * very fast ramp-up time
